# Cafe Sales Data

This dataset can be obtained [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training).
This is a fabricated data intended to help us practice with data cleaning. It is also a good dataset to practice for data visualizations.
The features in this data are quite basic, thus further analysis is harder to do from it.
Observations are also pretty much straight forward.
